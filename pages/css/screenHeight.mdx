# Full Screen Height

```scss copy
.element {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

## 🏕️ Dev Note
There is a rendering bug if you use “height: 100vh”
If the element child or children extend beyond the height of the screen it will show transparent space when you scroll down the page. 

Use “min-height: 100vh” instead to work around this, this method works as you would expect it to. (Note: only tested in Chrome so far)
